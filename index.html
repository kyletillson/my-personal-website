    <p id="mypara">I'm 20 years old, my birthday is December 23, 2001. I was born in Colorado, and have lived here ever since. I have always had an interest in technology whether it was building, learning, or acting on what I had learned.  I grew up playing baseball which consumed most of my life at that time but was well worth it. I love photography, and I have a strong passion for cars.

        <h3>Why I chose this field</h3>
        <p id="para">I originally went into trade school to become an automotive technician at Wyotech, in Laramie, Wyoming. Unfortunately, during my time there I had a cavernous malformation. It put me out for a long time and I had to get brain surgery to remove it. After my recovery, I still tried to pursue a career in the automotive field. I ended up getting a job at Autonation and worked there for about half a year before my body and brain couldn’t take it anymore. I then decided it would be best to choose a field that didn’t require  me to put my body through constant strenuous work all the time. I started to get certifications through Comptia, before I decided I wanted to become a software engineer.
